Thanks for buying this pack!

Short and sweet version.

Generally the quickest way to get started is to drag in one of the prefabs from the 'Beating Hearts/Prefabs' folder.

If you want to edit the bars value at runtime simply edit the currentValue field.

Other values
Min Heart Size: This is how small the heart will shrink to as a cap. It will generally shrink according to its current value (0.5 when 0.5 the value is 0.5, 1.5 etc)
Max Heart Size: This is the max size of the heart relative to the current value. Think of this as the size the heart beats to when the current value is 0
Min Beating Time: The slowest speed the heart will beat at, seen when the current value is close to 1 
Max Beating Time: The fastest speed the heart will beat at, seen when the current value is close to 0
